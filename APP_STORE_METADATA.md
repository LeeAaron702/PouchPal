## Review Notes for Apple
```
PouchPal is a simple counter/tracker app that helps users monitor daily consumption of any item they choose to track. The default terminology is "pouches" but users can customize this to track anything (snacks, beverages, cigarettes, etc.).

No account or sign-in required. All data is stored locally on the device using SwiftData.

The app requests notification permissions only when the user explicitly enables notifications in settings. Notifications are used for:
- Approaching daily limit alerts
- Daily limit reached alerts  
- Optional daily summary reminders

Widget functionality requires App Group entitlement to share data between the main app and widget extension.
